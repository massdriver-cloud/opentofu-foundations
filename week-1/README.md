# Week 1 Course: Introduction to OpenTofu and Basic Commands

**Duration:** 1 hour


## Introduction

Welcome to week one of the OpenTofu workshop! In this module, you'll learn how to create an EC2 instance running NGINX, set up a MariaDB database, and configure basic infrastructure in AWS. Weâ€™ll go through creating instances, security groups, and databases while discussing key Terraform/OpenTofu concepts.

**Important**: The goal of this session is _not_ to create the most reliable, secure infrastructure. We're trying to do the bare minimum AWS so we can focus on OpenTofu and IaC concepts.

## Course Objectives

- Understand the purpose and benefits of OpenTofu.
- Set up your first OpenTofu project.
- Learn foundational concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Write your first OpenTofu configuration.
- Define basic infrastructure resources like compute instances and networking components.
- Familiarize yourself with common OpenTofu commands: `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.
- Understand providers, resources, variables, and outputs.
- Interpret the output of `tofu plan` to preview infrastructure changes.

## Key Commands

Commands you'll use to manage your infrastructure.

`tofu init`
`tofu fmt`
`tofu validate`
`tofu plan`
`tofu apply`
