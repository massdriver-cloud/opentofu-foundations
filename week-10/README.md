# Week 10: Tooling and Best Practices in OpenTofu

## **Introduction**

This week, weâ€™ll focus on essential tools that ensure your OpenTofu configurations are reliable, secure, and maintainable. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll have enabled key tools, understood their value, and integrated them into your workflow.

---

## **1. Setting up Pre-commit Hooks**

Pre-commit hooks run checks automatically before code is committed, saving time and reducing errors.

While they're a great tool for ensuring quality before committing to git, they're also a great way to learn these tools without waiting for CI. :D

### **Setup Pre-commit**
Install pre-commit and initialize the hooks:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Add `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to your repo root:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/tofuutils/pre-commit-opentofu
    rev: v2.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: tofu_fmt
      - id: tofu_validate
      - id: tofu_tflint
      - id: tofu_docs
      - id: tofu_providers_lock
      - id: tofu_checkov
      - id: infracost_breakdown
```

**Aside:** If you want to limit these to running for just week 10 see the configuration in [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

Run the hooks manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## **2. A Tour of OpenTofu Tooling**

### **2.1 Tofu Format (`tofu_fmt`)**

#### What It Does
- Aligns code blocks for consistent indentation and spacing.
- Ensures your code adheres to OpenTofu's style guidelines.

#### Exercise
Run the formatter on a module:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_fmt --all-files
```

- Look at any changes made to your `.tf` files.
- Add unaligned code and rerun to see it corrected.

#### Tips & Best Practices
- Run `tofu_fmt` before committing changes to catch style issues early.
- Use `tofu fmt -check` in CI pipelines to enforce formatting.

---

### **2.2 Tofu Validate (`tofu_validate`)**

#### Contextual Setup
Validation ensures that your configuration files are syntactically correct and ready for deployment.

#### What It Does
- Catches syntax errors in `.tf` files.
- Validates that all required inputs are defined.

#### Exercise
Run validation on your module:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_validate --all-files
```

Try intentionally breaking syntax (e.g., delete a closing brace) and see the error it produces.

#### Tips & Best Practices
- Always run `tofu_validate` after adding new resources or variables.
- Use in conjunction with `tofu plan` to catch logical errors.

---

### **2.3 TFLint (`tofu_tflint`)**

#### Contextual Setup
TFLint is a framework and each feature is provided by plugins, catching common misconfigurations.

#### What It Does

- Find possible errors (like invalid instance types) for Major Cloud providers (AWS/Azure/GCP).
- Warn about deprecated syntax, unused declarations.
- Enforce best practices, naming conventions.

#### Exercise

Add a `.tflint.hcl` config file:

```hcl
plugin "terraform" {
  enabled = true
  preset  = "recommended"
}
```

Introduce an invalid instance type:
```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t1.micro"  # Invalid
}
```

Run the linter:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_tflint --all-files
```

Fix the error by switching to `t3.micro` and rerun.

#### Tips & Best Practices

- Update TFLint plugins regularly to stay current with your cloud provider.
- Customize rules for organizational policies, like enforcing specific tags.

---

### **2.4 Module Documentation (`tofu_docs`)**

Automatically generated documentation reduces manual work and ensures your modules are well-documented.

#### What It Does
- Updates your `README.md` with all inputs, resources, providers, modoules, and outputs.
- Ensures documentation is always up to date.

#### Exercise

Add fences to your README.md for tofu_docs to add documentation to:

```md
<!-- BEGINNING OF PRE-COMMIT-OPENTOFU DOCS HOOK -->
<!-- END OF PRE-COMMIT-OPENTOFU DOCS HOOK -->
```

Add a description to an input variable:
```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "The type of EC2 instance to launch."
  default = "t3.micro"
}
```

Run:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_docs --all-files
```

Check the updated `README.md`.

#### Tips & Best Practices

- Use detailed descriptions for inputs and outputs to improve module usability.
- Generate docs after every significant change to the module.

---

### **2.5 Provider Version Locking (`tofu_providers_lock`)**

Locking provider versions ensures reproducible builds and prevents breaking changes from updates.

#### What It Does
- Locks provider versions in `.terraform.lock.hcl`.
- Ensures your team uses consistent provider versions.

#### Exercise
Run the provider lock tool:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_providers_lock --all-files
```

Inspect the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file and note the locked versions.

#### Tips & Best Practices
- Use version ranges like `~> 3.0` for flexibility within a major version.
- Update locks periodically to stay secure and compatible.

---

### **2.6 Checkov (`tofu_checkov`)**

Checkov scans your configuration for security misconfigurations, ensuring compliance with best practices.

#### Checkov v. Trivy v. Terrascan

These tools aren't mutually exclusive, but their value becomes clearer as your organization grows and faces new challenges. Checkov is often the first stepâ€”easy to integrate, great for catching Terraform misconfigurations, and enforcing compliance. But as your infrastructure scales and your security needs become more complex, youâ€™ll start reaching for Terrascan for custom policies or Trivy to tackle vulnerabilities in container images, dependencies, and other assets beyond Terraform.

The overlap between these tools isnâ€™t a bad thingâ€”it reflects the natural progression of security as organizations mature. You might start with Checkov because itâ€™s lightweight and effective, then bring in Terrascan when you need policy flexibility or Trivy when your stack grows into containers and runtime environments. Itâ€™s not about picking the perfect tool, but about layering the right ones as your needs expand. Start small, scale smart.

### **Comparison Table**

| Feature                     | **Terrascan**                       | **Trivy**                          | **Checkov**                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|

| **Languages/Files Supported**| Terraform, Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation | Container images, IaC, file systems, runtime environments | Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation |
| **Vulnerability Scanning**  | No                                  | Yes                                 | No                                  |
| **Compliance Standards**    | Yes (OPA extensible)                | Yes                                 | Yes                                 |
| **Runtime Environment Scan**| No                                  | Yes (e.g., Kubernetes clusters)    | No                                  |
| **Policy Extensibility**    | OPA policies                        | Limited                             | Custom rules in YAML               |
| **SBOM Generation**         | No                                  | Yes                                 | No                                  |

**Checkov** is your go-to for quick, powerful checks that catch Terraform misconfigurations and ensure compliance. It's simple to set up, integrates nicely into CI/CD pipelines, and provides a solid foundation for any Terraform-heavy workflow. 

**Terrascan** steps in when you need more customization. With its Open Policy Agent (OPA) backend, you can write highly specific policies that align with your organization's needs. 

**Trivy**, on the other hand, is the multitoolâ€”it does Terraform misconfig checks but shines when you need to scan container images, runtime environments, or dependencies alongside your infrastructure.


#### What It Does
- Flags issues like open security groups or unencrypted storage.
- Checks compliance against frameworks like SOC2 or NIST.

#### Exercise
Run Checkov on a module:
```bash
pre-commit run tofu_checkov --all-files
```

Example warning:
```
CKV_AWS_20: "Ensure S3 buckets are not public"
File: main.tf:12-19
Resource: aws_s3_bucket.public_bucket
```

Fix the issue and rerun.

#### Tips & Best Practices
- Focus on critical issues to improve security posture incrementally.
- Use Checkov in CI to prevent insecure code from being deployed.

### **2.7 Infracost (`infracost_breakdown`)**

#### Contextual Setup
Infracost estimates the cost of your infrastructure, enabling cost-conscious decisions.

#### What It Does
- Provides cost breakdowns for your resources.
- Helps identify expensive configurations before deployment.

#### Exercise
Run Infracost:
```bash
pre-commit run infracost_breakdown --all-files
```

Check the output and identify the most expensive resource.

#### Tips & Best Practices
- Use Infracost during pull requests to enforce cost-awareness.
- Share breakdowns with stakeholders to justify infrastructure costs.

## **Challenges**

1. Run `tofu_docs` and update a variable description.
2. Configure `tofu_tflint` and correct any detected issues.
3. Run `tofu_checkov` and fix or silence errors.

**Happy coding!** ðŸŽ‰
